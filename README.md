# DevOps-Netology
Repo for Netology projects

Ignored: 
1) Local .terraform directories, because no need to commit in repo
2) tfstate files
3) Crash logs, for same reason
4) .tfvars, bc often contain sensetive data
5) Override files, bc override resourses locally and so not checked in
6) CLI config files, bc you change it anyway on your local machine
